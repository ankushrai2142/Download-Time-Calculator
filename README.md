The calculator takes two inputs:
1-File Size (in MB or GB)
2-Internet Speed (in Mbps)
   It then calculates the download time using the formula:
   Time = File Size Ã· Download Speed

This helps users quickly understand how long a file download will take, making it easier to plan activities or manage data usage.
The result is typically shown in seconds or minute
